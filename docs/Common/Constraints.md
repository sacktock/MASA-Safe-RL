## Next Steps

- [CMDP](Constraints/Constrained%20Markov%20Decision%20Process%20(CMDP)) - Budgeted Constrained MDP.
- [LTL Safety](Constraints/LTL%20Safety) - Safety fragment of LTL as a monitor and constraint.
- [PCTL](Constraints/PCTL) - A simple Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic constraint.
- [Step-wise Probabilistic](Constraints/Stepwise%20Probabilistic) - Undiscounted probabilistic step-wise safety constraint.
- [Reach Avoid](Constraints/Reach%20Avoid) - A simple reach-avoid constraint.
- [ATL (Multi Agent)](Constraints/Multi%Agent) - Alternating Time Logic for Multi Agent Systems.
