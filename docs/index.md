MASA Safe RL Documentation documentation
========================================

Welcome to the Multi and Single Agent (MASA) Safe Reinforcement Learning library. The goal of this library to develop a set of common environments and interfaces for safe reinforcement learning research, spanning constrained MDPs, Probabilistic Constraints, Reach-Avoid, and LTL-safety (DFA) properties.
