# Multi and Single Agent Safe Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the Multi and Single Agent (MASA) Safe Reinforcement Learning library. The goal of this library to develop a set of common environments and interfaces for safe reinforcement learning research, spanning constrained MDPs, Probabilistic Constraints, Reach-Avoid, and LTL-safety (DFA) properties. 

## Installation 
- Please install conda: [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/channels/anaconda/packages/conda/overview)
